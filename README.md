🧠 Number Recognition – My First Neural Network Project

Hey there! 👋
This is my first project using a Neural Network and its been a great journey building it from scratch in Python with TensorFlow/Keras. Many failures and many trial-and-errors though being my first model felt great.

The model takes 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (from the MNIST dataset) and tries to predict the correct digit.
It’s a small step, but a big leap for me into the world of Deep Learning! 🚀

📝 Project Details:

-> Dataset Used: MNIST (comes preloaded with TensorFlow)

-> Input Shape: 28x28 grayscale images

-> Output: Predicted digit (0–9)

-> Model Type: Basic Sequential Neural Network

-> Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

-> Optimizer: Adam

-> Accuracy: Tested on MNIST test data
